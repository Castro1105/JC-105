        <h2>Traveling</h2>
        <p>Me and my family like to travel a lot during the year we sometimes go close by like a nearby state
            or go to a go somewhere else where is located farther away like Florida. We have only been out of the country once which 
            is when we went to for a trip in Mexico. In the picture below it is a place nearby my parents old
        home town </p>

        <p>Like I mentioned before we have been to Florida around 3 times already
            and we love going there because we go visit some family there and they live in a island 
            which is surrounded by the ocean which means we get to go to the ocean every day. We also
            head up to Orlando and go to many tourist attractions they have like Disney World and Universal 
            Studios</p>

        <p>Another state that we have gone is Georgia. We also have family here and although its not
            as fascinating as Florida it has been fun going.</p>
