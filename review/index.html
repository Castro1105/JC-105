    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
<p>I will be reviewing the book <Strong>Wonder</strong>. I have read this book many times and is honestly
    one of the best books I have read. More specifically, I will be describing some
main characters such as Auggie and a friend named Jack</p>
    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
<h2>Auggie</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
<p>Auggie is the main character of this book. He is a young kid that has facial
    differences and has been home schooled until his parents finally decided
    it was time for him to go to his local school. He meets new friends as well as some
    bullies along the way but he overcomes it.</p>
    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
<h3>Jack</h3>
<p>Jack is one of Auggie's <em>best friends</em> that he met throughout the story. What 
    separated Jack from the other classmates is how he quickly accepted Auggie
    despite his difference as well as going above and beyond as defending Auggie 
    from his bully.
<q>"Do you ever want to beat those kids up?"-Jack</q><br>
