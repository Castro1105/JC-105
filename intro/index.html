   <p>I just recently started playing tennis and I usually play with my
    friends. This sport is really fun and makes me go out and do some
    exercise. The great thing is that I live close to a tennis court
    so I can go and play whenever I want. </p>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>

    <p>On my spare time I also enjoy playing video games. I have 
        a PS4 console at the moment. I play games like GTA and Rocket 
        League.</p>
    <h3>Building Legos</h3>
    <p>Another hobby of mine is actually building Legos. Recently
        I have bought some really cool lego sets like a big Ferrari.
        This hobby actually give me a sense of relaxation so I enjoy
        doing it a lot.</p>
